# Deepfake Duel: Truth vs. Trickery

**Deepfake Duel: Truth vs. Trickery** is a deep learning solution for detecting and classifying deepfake images. This project aims to accurately distinguish between real and manipulated images while also categorizing images into one of three classes: human faces, animals, or vehicles. The system leverages transfer learning using an Xception-based model, enhanced with modern training techniques such as mixed precision and gradient accumulation.

## Overview

In an era where deepfakes pose significant challenges in media authenticity, this project focuses on developing a robust deep learning model that:

- **Detects Deepfakes:** Classifies images as real or fake.
- **Categorizes Images:** Identifies the image category among human faces, animals, or vehicles.

By fine-tuning a pre-trained **Xception41** model from the [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) library, the system customizes the network into two separate heads: one for deepfake detection and one for category classification.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or later**
- **Conda** (recommended) or Virtualenv for environment management
- **CUDA-enabled GPU** (Optional, but strongly recommended) with appropriate NVIDIA drivers installed

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your_repository_url>
cd deepfake-duel
```

### 2. Create and Activate the Environment

Using **conda**:

```bash
conda create -n deepfake-env python=3.9 -y
conda activate deepfake-env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install required Python packages via pip. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure that you install a CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch if you have a compatible GPU. For example, using pip:*

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

(Adjust the CUDA tag according to your GPU’s compatibility.)

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, simply run the training script from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

- The script will:
  - Load the dataset using the metadata CSV.
  - Apply data augmentations using Albumentations.
  - Fine-tune the Xception-based model with two output heads using mixed precision and gradient accumulation.
  - Save the best model (based on validation loss) to `models/trained_weights/best_model.hy`.

### Inference

To generate predictions on the test set, run the inference script:

```bash
python predict.py
```

- This script loads the saved model and processes images in `data/test`, outputting a CSV (`test_predictions.csv`) with the model's predictions.

## Methodology

- **Model Architecture:**  
  The model uses a pre-trained **Xception41** backbone with two custom fully connected heads:
  - **Deepfake Detection Head:** Classifies images as real or fake (2 classes).
  - **Category Classification Head:** Determines the image category (3 classes: human_faces, animals, vehicles).

- **Data Handling:**  
  A custom dataset class reads image paths and labels from `metadata.csv`, applies necessary augmentations, and filters out missing files. This ensures robust input for training.

- **Training Optimizations:**
  - **Mixed Precision Training:** Uses `torch.amp` to reduce memory usage and accelerate computation.
  - **Gradient Accumulation:** Simulates a larger batch size while staying within GPU memory limits.
  - **Learning Rate Scheduler:** Utilizes Cosine Annealing LR scheduler for smoother convergence.

---

## Optimizations

- **Efficient Data Loading:** Using `pin_memory=True` and proper DataLoader settings.
- **Mixed Precision:** Reduces computational load and memory usage on GPUs.
- **Gradient Accumulation:** Allows for larger effective batch sizes.
- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Adjusts the LR during training to optimize learning.

---

## Evaluation

- **Metrics:**  
  The model is evaluated on a hold-out validation set using metrics such as loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed analysis and visualizations (e.g., loss curves, confusion matrices) are included in the final report.

- **Generalization:**  
  The model is tested on unseen data in the test set, ensuring that it doesn’t train on test data and that the performance is generalizable.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Augmentation:** Experiment with additional augmentations to improve robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use automated tools (e.g., Optuna) to optimize learning rates, batch sizes, etc.
- **Model Ensembling:** Combine predictions from multiple models for better accuracy.
- **Front-End Integration:** Develop a Streamlit-based demo for interactive inference.
- **Further Profiling and Optimization:** Explore using JIT compilation or further GPU memory optimizations.
